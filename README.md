# Reproducible Research - Course Project 1
This is a guide explaining the documents for this project. 

	* PA1_template.Rmd
	* PA1_template.md
	* PA1_template.htm
	
	
The goal is to make analytic data and code available so that others may reproduce findings .

## Input File
	The following input file was provided in the assigment.

	* 'activity.csv'


## Processing Steps
	The detailed steps used for this project are captured in PA1_template.Rmd. 
	
	There is always more than one way to implement a process.  
	Some of my coding decisions were very basic and simple. 
	I know as time goes on and I gain more experience in R, then how I write code will also improve.
	
	The project provided the following goals.
		1.	Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
		2.	Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
		3.	Mean and median number of steps taken each day
		4.	Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
		5.	The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
		6.	Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
		7.	Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
		8.	Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
		9.	All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report

				
## Output Files

	* README.md
		This is the file you are currently reading

	* PA1_template.Rmd
		This contains the code and steps.

	* PA1_template.md
		This is created by running with knit2html() function in R (from the knitr package) by running the function from the console.

	* PA1_template.htm
		This is created by running with knit2html() function in R (from the knitr package) by running the function from the console.
